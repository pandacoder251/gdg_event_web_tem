# # NovaStack Landing Page (gdg_event_web_tem)

This workspace contains a small static landing page prototype (HTML/CSS/JS) for the fictional product "NovaStack".

Files
- `index.html` — the landing page
- `style.css` — styles for layout and components
- `app.js` — small interactive behaviors (smooth scroll, testimonials, form stub)

Quick preview
1. Open `index.html` in your browser (double-click or use a static server).

Optional: start a simple static server (Python 3)

```bash
cd /workspaces/gdg_event_web_tem
python3 -m http.server 8000
# then open http://localhost:8000
```

Notes
- The contact form is a stub and does not send real requests — it simulates submission for demo purposes.
- `script.js` in the repository contained older/placeholder code; the page loads `app.js` now.

If you want any design changes, alternate color palette, or additional sections, tell me what to change.
