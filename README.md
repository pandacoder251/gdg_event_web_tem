## 🚀 Quick Start

This template is a static website, meaning you can run it directly in your browser or serve it with any static file server.

### Prerequisites

You only need a web browser to view the template. No specific software or runtime is required.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/pandacoder251/gdg_event_web_tem.git
    cd gdg_event_web_tem
    ```

2.  **Open in your browser**
    Simply open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser:
    ```bash
    # On macOS
    open index.html

    # On Windows
    start index.html

    # Or manually navigate to the file in your file explorer and double-click.
    ```

3.  **Start a simple development server (optional, but recommended)**
    For local development and testing, it's often better to serve static files via a local HTTP server.
    If you have Node.js installed, you can use `http-server`:
    ```bash
    # Install http-server globally if you haven't already
    npm install -g http-server

    # From the project root directory
    http-server
    ```
    Then, open your browser and visit `http://localhost:8080`.

## 📁 Project Structure

```
gdg_event_web_tem/
├── index.html        # Main HTML file for the event template
├── style.css         # All global and component-specific styling
├── app.clean.js      # Core JavaScript logic (e.g., responsive menu, animations)
└── README.md         # Project README file
```

## ⚙️ Customization

To customize this template for your specific GDG event:

1.  **Edit `index.html`**: Update all text content, event details, speaker information, agenda, and sponsor logos.
2.  **Modify `style.css`**: Adjust colors, fonts, spacing, and other visual styles to match your branding.
3.  **Update `app.clean.js`**: If you need to change interactive elements or add new JavaScript functionality, this is the place. For a basic event site, minimal changes are usually needed here.

## 🚀 Deployment
-   **Vercel**: Similar to Netlify, Vercel offers seamless static site hosting.
